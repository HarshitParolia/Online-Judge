User Authentication: Supports login via email/password, Google, Microsoft, GitHub, and Twitter IDs.
Problem Set: Provides a collection of problems with titles, statements, and input/output formats.
Code Execution: Executes user-submitted code in Python, Ruby, PHP, C/C++, or Java.
Contests: Hosts timed coding contests with automatic scoring, ranking, and leaderboard updates.
Admin Functionality: Allows admins to manage problems, create contests, and set problem details and durations.
Backend Security: Implements Docker for code isolation and virtualization to ensure security and prevent malicious user activities, with IP rate limiting for additional safety.
Technical Details
Stack: Built using MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for frontend and backend development.
Deployment: Utilizes Docker containers for scalability, security, and easy deployment across different environments.
